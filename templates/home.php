     <h4>What does Blue Ridge do?</h4>
     <p>Simple. We connect to your Basecamp account, grab all the To-Do items in all the To-Do lists, across all your projects and show them to you in one sortable easy to read list. <a href="">See a Screenshot</a></p>
     <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
     <p>Only $10 a month. A fraction of what it&rsquo;s worth. You&rsquo;ll save that time in the first day using it. No hidden fees. No minimum terms. Cancel anytime.</p>

     <h4>Why would I want it?</h4>
     <p>Do you have a time machine? Neither do we. We were sick of losing time searching for To-Dos and sorting them in our heads. With BlueRidge, you can see everything at once. The way it should be.</p>               
     <h4>What else does it do?</h4>
     <p>Nothing. This isn&rsquo;t another To-Do list app or a replacement for Basecamp. But it does make using Basecamp a whole helluva lot nicer.</p>
