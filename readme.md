BlueRidge
============

### Getting started
Head over to [Wiki - Getting Started ](https://github.com/jcornelius/blueridgeapp/wiki/Getting-Started) Page

### Workflow
#### Updating your working copy with the latest.

git pull , and grunt to view the lastest changes from [upstream](https://github.com/jcornelius/blueridgeapp)

**upstream** *is the main repo*
     
          # e.g Sean, Jason, Mo etc
          git pull upstream dev-master && grunt

          # J 
          git pull origin dev-master && grunt
          
 if you encounter pull errors, fix the conflicts, merge and commit the changes


#### Pushing up your code

          # everyone 
          git push origin dev-master
          
          
Everyone but J gets to create a pull request to have the code merged upstream
